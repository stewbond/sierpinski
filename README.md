# Sierpinski

This application uses an algorithm for interesting results.  Given a set of initial vertices, this algorithm will draw a dot in a random location.  Then it will ranomly choose a vertex and place a dot halfway between the selected vertex and the previous dot.  The result is interesting.  For three points (placed anywhere, doesn't have to be equilateral), the result is a Sierpinski trianle.

FRACTALS!
